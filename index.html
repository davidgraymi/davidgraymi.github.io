							<p>For as long as I can remember I have wanted to make the world a better place. Once in college I discovered how I can make that happen. I toyed with several different areas of study including graphic design, biology, medical school, and computer science. During the first years at Missouri State University I developed an understanding of my strengths and weaknesses. My natural abilities in problem solving, creativity, and mental visualization along with a strong desire to create led me to stay in the computer science department, but that did not stop me looking for interdisciplinary opportunities. After my Junior year, I applied to be a research assistant at the Computational Learning Systems Lab (CLSL) on campus. I was accepted to work under Dr. Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi developing python programs to analyze Traumatic Brain Injury data by utilizing the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE) algorithm. At the time I was working at O’Reilly Autoparts in their information technology department as a Quality Assurance Analyst. The assistantship lasted one month so I wanted to make the most out of it. Each day I would go to work at O’Reilly’s, come home and work two to six hours in the lab, eat, sleep, and do it again. Even with my densely packed schedule doing research with Professor Obafemi-Ajayi and graduate students never felt like a burden. Being in a fast-paced environment with other scientists who spoke the same language as me was an incredible experience. By the time it was over I realized that this type of environment suited me well and I wanted badly to be in it again. Although I wanted to continue research with Dr. Obafemi-Ajayi my first semester of Senior year proved to be challenging enough to keep me busy. As I write this, I am still in my first semester of Senior year and am developing a system that translates sign language into text. My endeavors in research truly feel like my chance to make the world a better place. I am so thankful for these opportunities and am working my hardest to better understand people, develop innovative technology, and advance the study of how technology can better serve our needs.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">As a developing computer scientist my philosophy revolves around the pursuit of knowledge, advancement in science, and improving the human experience. From a young age I have been fascinated by my own thoughts. Through the years, and with the right teachers, my fascination has evolved into a passion fueled search for understanding the complexities of human minds. This interest paired with my natural ability to excel in the sciences, particularly with computers, has led me to thinking deeply about human’s interaction with technology from a variety of perspectives. From an ethical perspective, I see advancement in technology, and how people can benefit from them physically, mentally, and emotionally, and cannot deny an individual the right to use the technology to their advantage. There are many worries about artificial intelligence and integration of computers with people, but my job is not to decide on restrictions and limitations. My job is to develop, engineer, and innovate. From a technical perspective I group technology into two categories by how it relates to people. The first category contains all technology that interacts with humans in a tangible way where sensory organs are necessary. This a broad range of technology that includes Siri voice control, remote controlled drones, or can be as simple as a lighting fixture. The second category is the opposite of the first and is defined as all technology that does not interact with people in a tangible way. For example, autopilot on an airplane or the software in scales that preforms mathematical equations to convert pressure into a standardized unit.</p>

I built software that uses the KNN algorithm to predict a handwirtten digit [0-9] from a grid of 784 pixels where each Each pixel contains an integer value between 0 and 255, inclusive and is arranged in a twenty-eight by twenty-eight array forming an image of the drawn digit. I went further and built a function that optimizes the k-value and reduces the number of times the KNN algorithm calculates distances for each unclassified object to one instance.

GitHub for everyone who doesn't use GitHub! Painless all-in-one document management service, document review lifecycle, team collaboration, search, and in browser editor. This solo side project, first started for my wife who complains about her works policy management platform, does not get the love it deserves from me. My hope is one day I hire some interns to do sales and clean up the list of backlog items I may never get to while I am in grad school.

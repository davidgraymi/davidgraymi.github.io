This is a school project to create a NLP pipeline for a patient care portal. User queries are triaged to the correct team (insurance, scheduling, medical advice, etc.) and information retrieval is performed so patients can read relevant evidence based research while waiting for a professionals advice. I created the classifier using pytorch that uses the output from [Google's latest Embedding Gemma 300m model](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/embeddinggemma) to classify sentence embeddings.

My tenure at Boeing has been defined by diving deep into the entire stack of real-time embedded software for our weapon systems and using all of my extra brain power to develop empathetic DevSecOps solutions for myself and my team. Being introduced to low-level programming early in my career has given me a deep understanding of the "magic" that I used to think was part of all great applications.

- **Secured** multi-million dollar military contracts for Boeing's weapon product lines
- **Developed** a go https server to streamline integration testing, reducing testing time by 10X
- **Created** a portable system library for any RTOS or bare metal systems using C++, Docker, Bazel, and GitLab, reducing engineering hours by 4X.
- **Engineered** a processor from the ground up (kernels, task scheduler, communication protocol, etc), using C and Ada. Now in production for **global distribution**
- **Led** reverse engineering efforts for critical cross-program missile interfacing application, improving real-time telemetry decoding and control functionalities, using C#, WPF, and XAML
- **Conducted** integration tests and data analysis for computer vision enhancements and requirements verification using Python, a simulation environment, and an experimental aircraft (I actually got to fly!)
- **Optimized** Jenkins and GitLab DevOps pipelines for efficiency gains using Python, Batch, and shell
- **Support** autonomous vehicle functions by retrieving and processing data from sensors like GPS, using Ada and C++
- **Modernized** security measures by adding warnings to an in-house Ada static code analysis app, using C++

My main responsibilities in the lab included writing python programs for preprocessing high volumes of data to fit the algorithms under study, running the data through the algorithms, and recording results in a readable format using libraries like matplotlib, pandas, and scikitlearn. I presented my results to the professor and graduate students I worked under at the end of the month.

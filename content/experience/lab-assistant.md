As a computer lab assistant at Missouri State University I help students and faculty on campus with any computer related issues. This normally consists of downloading and installing software, guiding software use, or troubleshooting connection issues. This experience has exposed me to a variety of softwares and computer issues giving me a well rounded understanding of personal computers, networks, applications, and general technology usage.

- Resolve university network issues on personal and university computers and lab equipment
- Communicate information to peers, work as a team to solve problems, and create documentation for issues

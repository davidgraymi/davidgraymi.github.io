During my time at O’Reilly Autoparts I was tasked with daily challenges involving testing software and optimizing test workflow. Testing involved detailed documentation on Jira and Confluence. Optimizating the testing workflow consisted of writing SQL queries based on prexisting queries from an old database.

- Optimized SQL queries for quick, accurate results
- Reviewed, tested, and approved test cases on production level software
- Wrote detailed documents on bugs found when testing

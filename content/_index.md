I am a highly driven Software Engineer and AI Specialist with 4+ years of professional experience in developing secure, high-performance, and real-time solutions across embedded systems and cloud platforms. Currently contributing deep expertise in C/C++, Go, and Linux to mission-critical systems at Boeing, where I have led efforts in platform portability, low-level kernel development, and anti-tamper security. My technical foundation is strengthened by advanced knowledge in AI/ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch), demonstrated through portfolio projects like a 98.8% accurate Sign Language Translator, and a strong background in full-stack development using Go, Vue, and AWS. I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to further my specialization in cutting-edge computer science and engineering.
